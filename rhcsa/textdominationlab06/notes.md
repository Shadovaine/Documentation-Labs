# Notes

## --- When to Create a Notes.md for a Lab ---
- When you have a "ohh, that's why"
- If a mistake is made worth not repeating
- If a command behaves differently than expected
- When a why is learned, not just the how
- When an exam trap is realized

## Key Takeaways (1-3 bullet points summarizing what this lab taught you)
- Lab ended sooner than expected due to /var/log/auth.log not having any 'Failed
