## --- When to Create a Notes.md for a Lab ---
- When you have a "ohh, that's why"
- If a mistake is made worth not repeating
- If a command behaves differently than expected
- When a why is learned, not just the how
- When an exam trap is realized

## Key Takeaways (1-3 bullet points summarizing what this lab taught you)

## What Tripped me up (Anything that slowed you down or caused confusion)

## Safety / Exam Warnings (Things that can break a system or cost points if done wrong)

## Security Implications

File Integrity monitoring is essential for detecting:
- Malware persistence
- Insider Threats
