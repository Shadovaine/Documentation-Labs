# Notes

## --- When to Create a Notes.md for a Lab ---
- When you have a "ohh, that's why"
- If a mistake is made worth not repeating
- If a command behaves differently than expected
- When a why is learned, not just the how
- When an exam trap is realized

## Key Takeaways (1-3 bullet points summarizing what this lab taught you)

- Filesystem types in use: tmpfs, vfat, squashfs, devtmpfs, efivarfs, ext4
## Decisions

- Chose read-only inspection to avoid altering baseline state
- Used standard tools available on minimal installations
- Avoided third-party utilities for portability
-

## What Tripped me up (Anything that slowed you down or caused confusion)


---

## Important Behaviors / Gotchas (Non-obvious command behavior, defaults, or edge cases)


---

## Safety / Exam Warnings (Things that can break a system or cost points if done wrong)


---

## Mental Model / Rules of Thumb (Simple rules you want burned into memory)

- Chose read-only inspection to avoid altering baseline state
- Used standard tools availabel on minimal installations
- Avoided third-party utilities for portability
